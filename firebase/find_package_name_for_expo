HOW TO FIND PACKAGE NAME FOR EXPO APP:

Here's how you can find the package name for your Expo app:

Expo app.json File:
In your React Native Expo project, you should have an app.json file at the root of your project directory. 
Open this file in a text editor.

Locate the slug Field:
In the app.json file, you will find a field called "slug". This field specifies the URL-safe project name and 
is used as the basis for generating the package name.

Example:-

app.json
Copy code
"slug": "my-expo-app",
Derive the Package Name:
The package name for your Android app is typically derived from the slug field in the following format: 
	host.exp.exponent + slug.

So, if your slug is "my-expo-app", the package name for your Android app would be host.exp.exponent.myexpoapp.

Example:-

app.json
Copy code
"android": {
  "package": "host.exp.exponent.myexpoapp"
}

This package name is used when registering your app in the Firebase Console and when configuring other 
Android-related settings.

Remember that the package name is case-sensitive, so make sure it matches the value you provide when registering 
your app in Firebase or when configuring other services.
