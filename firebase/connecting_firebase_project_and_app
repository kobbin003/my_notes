CONNECTING FIREBASE PROJECT WITH YOUR PROJECT:

here are step-by-step instructions to help you fill out the "Add Firebase to your Android app" section in your 
Firebase project:

1. ** Go to Firebase Console: **
   Visit the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account. 
   Make sure you are in the Firebase project you want to use with your React Native Expo app.

2. ** 1Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏è Add a Project (if not already created):**
   If you haven't created a Firebase project for your app, click "Add Project" and follow the prompts to set up a 
   new Firebase project. Otherwise, select your existing project.

3. ** Access Project Settings: **
   In the Firebase Console, click on the gear icon (settings) located near the top left corner of the page, 
   then select "Project settings."

4. ** Add an App to Your Project: **
   In the "General" tab of the project settings, scroll down to the "Your apps" section and find the platform 
   (Android) you want to add your app to. Click on the platform to start the setup process.

5. ** 2Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏è Register Your App: **
   You'll be prompted to register your app. Provide the following information:

   - ** Nickname: ** This is a friendly name for your app within the Firebase project.
   
   - ** Package Name: ** This should match the package name of your React Native Expo app. You can find this in your 
   `app.json` file under the `"android"` key, within the `"package"` field.
    
    ‚≠êÔ∏è checkout this note for more info on package name: üóíÔ∏è find_package_name_for_expo
   
   - ** Debug Signing Certificate SHA-1:** You can generate this by running the following command in your project 
   directory and copying the SHA-1 fingerprint:

    üßë‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
     

   - **App Signing Certificate SHA-1 (optional):** If your app is also signed for production, provide the SHA-1 fingerprint for the production keystore.

   - **App nickname (optional):** This is an optional nickname for your app within Firebase.

6. ** Continue to Console: **
   After filling out the required information, click the "Register App" button.

7. ** 3Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏è Download Config File: **
   Firebase will generate a configuration file named `google-services.json`. Download this file to your computer.

8. ** Add Config File to Your Expo Project: **
   Place the `google-services.json` file in the root directory of your React Native Expo project.
	
	4Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏è Add Firebase SDK:
		üßë‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è npx expo install firebase

9. ** Initialize Firebase in Your App: **
   In your app's entry point (e.g., `App.js`), initialize Firebase using the configuration object from the 
   `google-services.json` file. You can use the code snippet provided in the Firebase Console, but make sure to 
   include the relevant import statements.

10. ** Test Firebase Integration: **
    You can now test Firebase services in your app, such as Firebase Authentication or Firestore, using the Firebase 
    JavaScript SDK.

11. ** Review and Save: **
    After setting up your app in Firebase, review the settings and make sure everything is correct. Click "Save and 
    Continue."

12. **Follow Additional Steps:**
    Depending on the Firebase services you plan to use (e.g., Firebase Authentication, Firestore, Realtime Database), 
    you may need to follow additional setup steps as mentioned in Firebase's documentation for those services.

That's it! You've successfully filled out the "Add Firebase to your Android app" section in your Firebase project and 
integrated Firebase with your React Native Expo app on Android. You can now use Firebase services in your app and take 
advantage of features like authentication, real-time databases, cloud storage, and more.
