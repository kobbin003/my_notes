	▶️ s_client command implements a generic SSL/TLS client which can establish a
	   transparent connection to a remote server speaking SSL/TLS. It's
	   intended for testing purposes only and provides only rudimentary
	   interface functionality but internally uses mostly all
	   functionality of the OpenSSL ssl library.
