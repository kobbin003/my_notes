   LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):

	- LCP is a web performance metric that measures the loading speed and visual stability of a web page.
	- It specifically focuses on the time it takes for the largest and most significant content element 
	  (such as an image or text block) to render on the screen.
	- LCP helps assess the user's perception of a page's loading speed, with a good LCP indicating 
	  that the main content becomes visible quickly.

   FID (First Input Delay):

	- FID is another web performance metric that measures the responsiveness of a web page or web application.
	- It quantifies the delay between the first user interaction (e.g., a click or tap) and the time when the browser 
	  responds to that interaction by initiating a specific action, such as scrolling or loading a new page.
	- FID is important because it directly relates to the user's experience and how quickly they can interact with a 
	  webpage.

   CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):

	- CLS is a web performance metric that assesses the visual stability of a web page during loading.
	  It measures how much the layout of a page shifts or changes as content loads, which can be frustrating for users 
	- if elements jump around or cause them to click on unintended items.
	- A low CLS score means that the page's content is stable and doesn't shift unexpectedly.
