why does the useState state persists when i save my react code?
[ in spotify clone <Home/> ]

In React, the state of a component is intended to be local and persistent within the component's scope. 
This means that when you update the state using useState, the state changes are retained as long as the component 
is not unmounted or the state is not explicitly reset.

React's state management preserves the state of each component as long as the component remains mounted.

When you save your React code and then refresh the page, the component tree is re-rendered and the components 
are re-created. However, React's state management preserves the state of each component as long as the component 
remains mounted. This is why you might see the state values persisting even after a refresh.
