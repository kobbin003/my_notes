			⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ PROPS v/s ATTRIBUTES : ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
			
👉️👉️👉️ "props" are for React Components.
	   WHEREAS "attributes" are "in-built" as well as "custom" in the HTML elements like <input/> etc.
	  
	  ▶️ setting props:
	     - <Comp prop1={"value"} prop2={a_variable_set_in_the_component}> ...elements </Comp>
	  
	  ▶️ Dynamic setting of prop:
	     - <Comp prop1={state} /> ; then use setState() to update state

	  ▶️ setting attributes: 👁️‍🗨️️[ only inbuilt attributes can be added ]👁️‍🗨️️
	     - <input type="text" id="id" />
	  
	  ▶️ Dynamic setting of attributes: 👁️‍🗨️️[ Here, custom attributes can be added ]👁️‍🗨️️
	     - element.setAttribute("key","value")
	     
👉️👉️👉️ PREFER "class" over "className" in react, if you want to control "adding" and "removing" of class.
	   IN THIS CASE we will be using setAttribute() and removeAttribute().
	   BUT Keep in mind the element has to be a HTML_ELEMENT. or else use className
