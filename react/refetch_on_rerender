USING FETCHHOOK IN A COMPONENT:
(SO AS TO TRIGGER REFETCH DATA ON COMPONENT RERENDER)

The data fetched by the "useEffect hook" inside the "fetchhook" is only updated 
once when the component is "initially rendered", and "subsequent re-renders" of the component
will trigger a re-fetch of the data "only if" the dependency of the useEffect changes.

Therefore "re-rendering" a component will trigger the fetchhook to "re-fetch data" only if 
there is change in the dependency.
