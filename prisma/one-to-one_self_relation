one-to-one self relation:

e.g:-
	model User {
	  id       Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
	  followers  User[]  @relation("followerRelation")
	  follower   User?   @relation("followerRelation", fields: [followerId], references: [id], onDelete: NoAction, onUpdate: NoAction)
	  followerId String? @unique
	}
	
	@relation("followerRelation", fields: [followerId], references: [id],....)
	: this attribute establishes the relation, specifying that the parentId field in this model 
	refers to the id field of the same model.
	
	parentId
	: holds the id of self/Chapter's id
	
	children Chapter[] @relation("therelation")
	: represents the "opposite" relation of the relation "followerRelation". 
	
✴️ when you query user's followers using the followers field, it fetches all users who are following the current user.
