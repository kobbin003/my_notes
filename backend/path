 The __dirname variable is only available in CommonJS modules (i.e., files executed by Node.js directly).

If you are using __dirname in an ECMAScript module (ESM) context, __dirname won't be available. 
Instead, you can use the import.meta.url property in an ESM context to get 
the current script's URL, and then extract the directory path from it.

this:
const __filename = (new URL(import.meta.url)).pathname;
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

we use import.meta.url to get the current script's URL and then convert it to a local file path 
using URL and pathname. Finally, we use path.dirname() to get the directory name of the current script,
