npm i passport-google-oauth2

⭐️  no need for expiry time,
	passport has isAuthenticated method() to check if the user is authenticated.
	
⭐️  in the Google OAuth 2.0 authentication flow, there is typically no need for a direct exchange of tokens 
	between the frontend and backend of your application. Google OAuth handles the token exchange as part of 
	the authentication process, and Passport.js (or your chosen authentication library) takes care of managing 
	these tokens behind the scenes.
	
	this is how th auth middleware, in case of passportjs looks like:-
	
	🧑‍💻️ 🧑‍💻️ 🧑‍💻️
	export function ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
	if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
		return next(); // User is authenticated, continue to the next middleware
	}
		res.redirect("/login"); // User is not authenticated, redirect to the login page
	}
