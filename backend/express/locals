⚡️ res.locals (Response Local Variables):

res.locals is specific to a single request-response cycle.

It is an object that allows you to store data that is scoped to the current HTTP request and response pair.

You typically use res.locals within a specific route handler to pass data from the server to a view template 
that will be rendered for that particular request.

⚡️ app.locals (Application Local Variables):

app.locals is global to the entire Express.js application and persists throughout the application's lifecycle.

It is an object that allows you to store data that should be accessible across all request-response cycles.

Data stored in app.locals is shared among all clients and all routes within your Express.js application.
