				
				MIDDLEWARE INVOCATION :

 1. through binding to an app or router object
 2. immediate
 
 Suppose I have a middleware:
 
 const middleWare = (req, res, next) => {
	/* does something with req, res*/
	next(error);
};

This middleware can be invoked in two ways :

 1️⃣️. through binding
 
 app.use(middlware)
 
 ⚡️ middleware is executed anytime a request is received(since it is bound on the root)
 
 2️⃣️. immediate invocation :
 
 app.get("/some_route", (req,res,next) =>{
 	middleware(req,res,next)
 })
 
 ⚡️ here middleware is invoked immediately.
 ⚡️ middleware should be called with routes' callback function's req, res, next as it's args values.
 ⚡️ for example, refer passport.authenticate()
