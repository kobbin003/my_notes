web-worker:

1. create the instance of worker:
	const counter: Worker = useMemo(
		() => new Worker(new URL("./longProcesses/count.ts", import.meta.url)),
		[]
	);
	
	
2. Communicate with the worker i.e count.ts:

	self.onmessage = (e: MessageEvent<string>) => {
	console.log("message received", e.data);
	};
	
	👉️ worker methods = postMessage, onMessage, onerror, terminate etc..
	  
	👉️ cross communication can be done between worker and it's instance through those methods
