$in and $all:

⚡️these both are applied on an array;


example: pingpong app(getUserChats controller)

$in :-
const chat = await ChatModel.find({ relation: { $in: chatIds } });
here, we will get all chat's whose relation field's value contains any of the value inside chatIds(which is an array)

$all :-
const chat = await ChatModel.find({ relation: { $all: chatIds } });
here, we will get all chat's whose relation field's value contains all of the value inside chatIds(which is an array)

⭐️ This makes more sense if relation = an array;

 But for single value, which in my case of pinpong app is ObjectId, it only makes sense to use "$in".

⭐️ This is allmost like chatIds.map(id=>find({relation==id}))
