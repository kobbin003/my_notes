advantages of mongoose:

Mongoose is an Object-Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB and provides several advantages that make working with MongoDB in a Node.js environment more convenient:

1. **Schema Definition:**
   - Mongoose allows you to define a schema for your documents. This schema defines the structure, types, and validation rules for your data.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
       name: { type: String, required: true },
       email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
     });
     ```

2. **Middleware:**
   - Mongoose supports middleware functions that allow you to define functions that execute before or after certain events (e.g., before saving a document, before validating, etc.).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     userSchema.pre('save', function (next) {
       // Some logic before saving the document
       next();
     });
     ```

3. **Query Building:**
   - Mongoose provides a fluent API for building queries, making it easier to construct complex queries.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     UserModel.find({ age: { $gte: 18 } }).sort({ name: 1 }).exec(function (err, users) {
       // Handle the result
     });
     ```

4. **Middleware Hooks:**
   - Mongoose allows you to define hooks for various operations, such as pre-save, pre-validate, and post-save hooks.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     userSchema.pre('save', function (next) {
       // Some logic before saving the document
       next();
     });
     ```

5. **Validation:**
   - Mongoose provides built-in validation for your schema, allowing you to ensure that your data meets certain criteria before being saved.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
       name: { type: String, required: true },
       email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true, validate: isEmail },
     });
     ```

6. **Population:**
   - Mongoose supports population, allowing you to reference other documents in your schema and automatically retrieve them when querying.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
       name: String,
       posts: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Post' }],
     });
     ```

While MongoDB provides a flexible and powerful query language, Mongoose adds an additional layer of abstraction and 
features that make it easier to work with MongoDB in a Node.js environment, especially when building 
complex applications. It simplifies the interaction with the database, provides a consistent API, and offers 
tools for schema definition and data validation.
