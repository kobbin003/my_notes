HOST vs VM vs CONATAINERS:

Host System: 
The host operating system runs its own kernel, which manages hardware resources and provides services 
to applications and processes running on the host.

Virtual Machines (VMs): 
Each VM runs its own guest operating system and, consequently, its own kernel. 
These kernels operate independently of the host system's kernel. 
Virtualization technology allows multiple kernels to run on the same physical hardware.

Containers: 
Containers share the host system's kernel. 
They do not require a separate guest OS or kernel because they leverage the host system's kernel. 
This makes containers lightweight and allows them to start up quickly.
