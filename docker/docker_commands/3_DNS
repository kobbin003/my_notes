DNS:

DNS is important in docker because we cannot rely on IP addresses inside containers since things are so dynamic.
IPaddress are assigned to containers based on the order in which the containers are started, which may change.

Solution is "DNS naming"

Docker DNS:
Docker daemon has a built in DNS server that containers use by default.

Docker takes "container names"  as the equivalent of a "host name" for containers talking to each other.

	🗒️🗯️🛑️ using IP for talking to containers is anti-pattern. Avoid doing it.

⭐️ Features of custom/user-defined network:
 
- Automatic DNS resolution for all containers on that virtual network.
 which means that you can communicate with containers using their "container name" instead of their "IP Address".
 
 e.g: docker container exec -it <server-1-container> ping <server-2-container>
 		[It will work "provided" that both the server containers are in custom-network ]

 ‼️"bridge network" does not have automatic DNS resolution feature.
