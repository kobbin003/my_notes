Multiple containers with the same DNS(alias):
Used in LOAD BALANCING
[multiple server instances with DNA aliases that responds to the same DNS]

⭐️ KEYWORD: --network-alias

< docker container run -d --network ${network name} --network-alias ${network alias name} ${image} >

	e.g:  docker container run -d --network my_net --network-alias search elasticsearch:2 
	- This runs a container with network alias as "search"

	- We can create multiple containers with the same network alias i.e "search".

	- Docker round robins the request sent to the network-alias.

⭐️ Example: 
	I have two server container running, say server1 and server2

	I have attached network alias named "search" to both of these containers network.

	If I run a new container and run < ping search > :- the reponse will be from server1

	and if I stop the above ping and run < ping search > again, the response will be from server2

⭐️ How to check all the ipaddress mapped with the network-alias:
	
	nslookup: < nslookup ${network_alias} >
	- The nslookup command is used to query domain name servers to obtain domain name or IP address mapping or other 
	  DNS records.
