Image_commands:

1. docker image history ${image_name}
	: shows all the layers that an image is made of.
	⭐️ Each layer are uniquely identified and stored only once in a host
	⭐️ This saves storage on the host as well as transfer time on push/pull.

🗒️⭐️ A container is just a read/write layer on top of image.

2. docker image inspect ${image_name}
	: shows all the details of an image
	  It basically is all the "metadatas" of an image.
	  
3. docker image tag ${source_image} ${target_image}
	e.g: docker image tag nginx kob009/nginx
	: creates a new image from the source_image with ${target_image} as it's name.
