bridge vs host in docker network:

In Docker networking, "bridge" and "host" are two different network modes that containers 
can use to communicate with the host system and other containers. 

Here's what each mode means:

### Bridge Network Mode:

- **Bridge Mode (Default):** When you create a Docker container without specifying a network mode, 
							 it is connected to the bridge network by default.
  
  - **Isolation:** Containers on the bridge network can communicate with each other using their container names. 
  					However, they are isolated from the host system's network interfaces, which provides a level 
  					of security.
  
  - **Port Mapping:** You can expose container ports to the host system using port mapping (e.g., `-p 8080:80`). 
  						This allows you to access services inside the container from your host machine.
  
  - **Internet Access:** Containers on the bridge network can access the internet if the host system has internet access.

### Host Network Mode:

- **Host Mode:** When you run a container with the `--network host` option, the container shares the network 
				namespace with the host system.
  
  - **No Isolation:** Containers in host mode share the network namespace with the host, meaning they use the host's 
  						network interfaces directly. This provides very low overhead networking, as there is no 
  						additional network virtualization.
  
  - **Port Mapping:** Port mapping is not required in host mode. If a service inside the container listens on a port, 
  						it is directly accessible on the host system at the same port number.
  
  - **Performance:** Host mode can offer better networking performance because there is no overhead from network 
  						address translation (NAT) or bridging.

### When to Use Each Mode:

- **Bridge Mode:** Use bridge mode when you want containers to be isolated from the host system and other containers, 
					and you want to manage port mappings between the host and containers. This mode provides a good 
					balance between security and functionality.

- **Host Mode:** Use host mode when you want containers to have direct access to the host system's network interfaces, 
					and you don't need network isolation between the host and containers. This mode provides the best 
					networking performance but reduces network isolation.
