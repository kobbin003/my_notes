Set PATH variable:

⚡️ PATH:
The PATH environment variable in a Unix-like operating system (including Linux) is a critical variable 
that determines where the system looks for executable files when you enter a command in the terminal.

⚡️ HOW TO SET PATH variable:

Syntax: < export VARIABLE_NAME=VARIABLE_PATH >

- "export": This command is used to set environment variables.

- use echo to see the variable set. e.g: < echo $PATH >
 
examples :- 
- export PATH=FIRST_PATH_NAME
- export PATH=$PATH:PATH_NAME_APPENDED
- export MYDOC=$HOME/Documents

There are many pre-defined variables like $PATH,$HOME etc..

⚡️ When you use the "export" command to set an environment variable like PATH in a terminal session, 
   it applies only to that specific session. 
   When you close the terminal or open a new one, the changes made in the previous session are not preserved. 
   This is because each terminal session is independent, and environment variables are specific to 
   the session in which they are set.
   
⚡️ To make changes to environment variables, such as PATH, "persistent across terminal sessions", 
	you need to define them in a configuration file like .bashrc, .bash_profile, or .profile.
	
	step 1: < nano $HOME/.bashrc >
	step 2: paste the export command in it and save it.
