# simplifying VM http server setup:

**options:**  
- startup script
- instance template
- custom image

## 1. Startup script:

**Bootstraping**: the process of installing os patches or software when VM instance is launched.

-- you can configure **startup script** in VM to bootstrap.  
 GOTO: create instance > advanced options >Management > Automation. write the script in that section.
 
 e.g for starting an apache server along with a VM instance:
 #!/bin/bash  
 apt update  
 apt -y install apache2  
 echo "Hello World! - $(hostname): $(hostname -i)"  
 
 ## 2. Instance Templates
It is very inconvenient to specify/choose VM instance details, every time you launch an instance.  
 You can simply create an template of Am instance which is called **instance template**.  
 Instance templates cannot be updated. But you can create a copy of one and then modify it.
 
 No cost is incurred in creating instance template. But the charge will be apllied if that template is used to run a VM instance.
 
 ### Compute Engine > Virtual Machines > Instance templates
 
 ## 3. Custom Image
 Installing os and software at launch of VM instances increases boot up time.  
 **custom image** has os patches and softwares pre-installed. Hence it helps in reducing the launch time.  
 
 -- custom images can be created from -  
 1. an instance
 2. a persistent disk
 3. a snapshot
 4. another file
 5. a file in cloud storage  

-- can be shared across projects.  

### steps involved:
### 1. creating image: Compute Engine > Storage > Disks

### 2. selecting image: boot disk(while creating VM instance or template) > CUSTOM IMAGES > select Image.
