- low latency.
- global footprint.

### a region is comprised of multiple zones. Its benefits are:
- increased availability within a region
- increased fault tolerance

### A zone is comprised of one or more clusters.
- a cluster is nothing but a distinct physical infrastructure that is housed in a data centre.

Zones in a region are connected through low latency links

### example:
