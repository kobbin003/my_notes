			🟡️ 🟡️ 🟡️ Scrypto’s authorization model starts with three core concepts: 🟡️ 🟡️ 🟡️ 

 👉️ Badges : 
		A badge is simply any token or resource that is used for authentication and authorization. 
		Badges can either be a Fungible or NonFungible resource type;
		
 👉️ Proofs : 
	Proofs are a transient instance of a resource that can only exist within the duration of the transaction. 
	For authorization and authentication, a Proof of the badge is sent instead of the actual badge. 
	This is because assets on Scrypto have physical characteristics. 
	When we send the physical badge to a component for authorization and authentication, 
	that badge is physically being transferred away from our possession to the vault’s possession, 
	effectively giving away our ownership of that badge. 
	This can be dangerous because sending a badge to a malicious component effectively allows that component 
	to use the badge for other means. 
	
 👉️ Access Rules :
	This can be dangerous because sending a badge to a malicious component effectively allows that component 
	to use the badge for other means. 

							🟡️ 🟡️ 🟡️ LEVELS of AUTHENTICATION 🟡️ 🟡️ 🟡️
 
 👉️ system-level authentication :
 	👁️‍🗨️️ accessrules.
 	After we’ve implemented AccessRules to our component, the Radix Engine can use the Proofs in the Authorization Zone 
 	and compare it against the badges specified in the component’s AccessRules.
 
	  ▶️ The Authorization Zone (AuthZone) :
	 	🏅️ Every transaction on the Radix Network contains a layer called the Authorization Zone or AuthZone.
	 	🏅️ All Proofs are submitted in the AuthZone.
	 	🏅️ Transactions submitted to the Radix Network are accompanied by the 👁️‍🗨️️transaction manifest.
	 	
 👉️ Application-level Authentication :
 	▶️ Passing Proofs by Intent:
 		While every Proof is automatically sent to the AuthZone, we are not confined to authenticating Proofs in 
 		the AuthZone.   
 		Instead, we can send Proofs directly to our component method(s) [👁️‍🗨️️ as an argument] to perform our own authentications. 
 		This way of applying application-level authentication is called Passing Proofs by Intent.
 	▶️ ProofValidation: 
 		When we pass a Proof directly to our component method(s), authentications are handled by ProofValidation
 	
 							🟡️ 🟡️ 🟡️ The .authorize() Method Expanded 🟡️ 🟡️ 🟡️
 	
 👉️ It’s worth noting the sequence of events of what .authorize() does under the hood. 
 	When .authorize() is called on a Vault or a Bucket(rarely) : 

		▶️ The method creates a Proof of the resource contained within the Vault or Bucket.

		▶️ The Proof is then pushed to the AuthZone

		▶️ It performs the specified sequences of logic within the enclosure of its argument.

		▶️ The Proof is popped from the AuthZone

		▶️ The Proof is then dropped.

		It does all these steps sequentially and automatically.

resource behaviour : authorize()
methods : pass proof during method-call
