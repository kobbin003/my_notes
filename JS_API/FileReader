FileReader:

FileReader is a built-in JavaScript object that provides a way to read the contents of files asynchronously. 
It's commonly used when you need to interact with files selected by users through HTML file input fields or 
when working with files in web applications. 
FileReader is especially useful for reading text and binary data from files.


👉️ Main methods:
	- readAsArrayBuffer(blob) – read the data in binary format ArrayBuffer.
	- readAsText(blob, [encoding]) – read the data as a text string with the given encoding (utf-8 by default).
	- readAsDataURL(blob) – read the binary data and encode it as base64 data url.
	- abort() – cancel the operation.
