Dynamically getting the property value of an object (Typescript) :

when trying to access a property of an object using a dynamic string key,
TypeScript cannot ensure that the property actually exists on the object. 
This can lead to runtime errors if the property is not present, 
so TypeScript requires you to explicitly declare the type of the property when you use a dynamic string key to access it.

So, to get the value:
you can either:

 👉️	Way 1 -
	(obj as any)[keyValue]
	
 👉️	Way 2 -
	type ValidKeys = "key1" | "key2" | "key3" .....
	const keyValue: ValidKeys = someValue 
	const value = obj[keyValue as ValidKeys]
