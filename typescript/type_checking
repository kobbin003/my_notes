						⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ TYPE CHECKING ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️

👉️ To perform a runtime type check, you can use a 👁️‍🗨️️ type guard function 👁️‍🗨️️ or use the instanceof operator 
   (if applicable).


👉️ in v/s typeof v/s instanceof:

	▶️ in: The in operator in JavaScript is used to check if a specified property exists in an object. 
		< "value" in x >

	▶️ typeof: The typeof operator in JavaScript is used to determine the type of a value or variable at runtime.
		< typeof x == "type">

	▶️ instanceof: The instanceof operator in JavaScript is used to check if an object belongs to a specific class or constructor function.
			< x instanceof type >

👉️ type:
	"string"
	"number"
	"bigint"	
	"boolean"
	"symbol"
	"undefined"
	"object"
	"function"
	
👉️ used in type-checking:
	typeof
	instanceof
	in
	keyof
	as (assertion)
	user-defined typeguards
