In CSS, both : (single colon) and :: (double colon) are used in selectors, 
but they have different meanings and use cases:

1. Single Colon (:):

The single colon : is used in regular pseudo-classes. 
Pseudo-classes are used to style elements based on their state. 

For example, :hover, :active, :focus are common pseudo-classes used to apply styles 
when an element is being hovered over, active, or focused, respectively.
Example: a:hover, input:focus, button:active

2. Double Colon (::):

The double colon :: is used for pseudo-elements. 
Pseudo-elements allow you to style a part of an element, 
such as the first line of a paragraph or the first letter of a heading, without adding additional markup to the HTML.

Example: ::before, ::after, ::first-line, ::first-letter
In modern CSS, both single and double colons are used interchangeably for pseudo-elements. 
However, the W3C recommends using double colons for pseudo-elements to distinguish them from pseudo-classes.
