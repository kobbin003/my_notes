-------------------------------------- transform: scale(_value):
* it does not work on elements that have inline type display;
  - to make it work assign {display: inline-block;}

* can be used to set text below 14px(it is the lowest allowed in the browser)

* use tranform-origin: top left; -> to maintain its start position as it was before the scale.


-------------------------------------- selecting nth-child from x to y:
[child]:nth-child(n+3) --> selects the child from 4th child
[child]:nth-child(-n+4) --> selects the child till 5th child

therefore to select 3rd and 4th child:
[child]:nth-child(n + 3):nth-child(-n + 4):hover

CORRECTION:
[child]:nth-child(n+3) --> selects the child from 3rd child
[child]:nth-child(-n+4) --> selects the child till 4th child

therefore to select 3rd and 4th child:
[child]:nth-child(n + 3):nth-child(-n + 4):hover

-------------------------------------- css position:
if you want to position a child relative to its parent:

set parent's position to relative and the child's position to absolute

***CORRECTION***
parent's position can be anything(It must be posiitoned though) other than static to get this result. 

"absolute: The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element."

-------------------------------------- { position: fixed } :
a fixed elements parent is body, not it's parent container.

So if you set it's width: 100%, it will be 100% of the body rather than 100% of it's parent container's size.

-------------------------------------- scroll bar width:
Setting width to 100vw can cause a horizontal scrollbar to appear because the vw unit takes into account the width 
of the entire viewport, including the width of any vertical scrollbars that are present.

Therefore to not let the horizontal scroller appear, do this:
.container{
width:calc(100vw - (100vw - 100%))
}

Here: 100vw = viewport_width + scrollbar_width; Thats why horizontal scroll bar appears, because width is greater than
the viewport_width.
& 100% = width of the parent of .container.
**provided the container's parent's width is equal to the viewport_width.
