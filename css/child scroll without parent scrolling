HOW TO SET CHILD TO SCROLL WITHOUT SCROLLING THE PARENT:

.container {
  /* ... */
  overflow: hidden;
  max-height: x; //* containers max-height should be such that 
  					"container-height" + "padding" + "other vertical items" should be < 100vh.
}

.child {
  overflow: scroll;
  height: //* see 👁️‍🗨️️ ;
  overscroll-behavior: contain; //* scrolling on child does not trigger the scroll event on the parent.
  								// * This will only scroll the parent container if your mouse leaves the child element to the parent.
  								//* NOT IMPORTANT in spotify clone.
}

 👁️‍🗨️️ " height of child " + " any element or space above it till the top of viewport "
	SHOULD NOT exceed 100vh 
	IN OTHER WORDS: " the bottom of the child element should not go below 100vh. " 
	OR ELSE scroll will get created on the <body>
